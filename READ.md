**Approach**:
The application is built using React as the frontend framework and Express.js as the backend server. The server is responsible for making the necessary API calls to fetch data from various sources, including the YouTube Data API, Google Custom Search API, and Semantic Scholar API. The client-side application handles the user interface, managing the state, and rendering the results.

**Technologies Used**:
- **Frontend**: React, React Hooks, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js, Node.js, googleapis, axios
- **APIs**: YouTube Data API, Google Custom Search API, Semantic Scholar API
- **Environment**: Node.js, npm

**Challenges Faced**:
1. **API Permissions and Credentials**: The initial challenge was setting up the API credentials and ensuring the necessary permissions were granted to access the APIs. This involved verifying the API keys, enabling the APIs in the Google Cloud Console, and configuring the API client correctly.
2. **Error Handling and Logging**: Dealing with API-related errors and providing meaningful error messages to the user was an important aspect of the implementation. The server-side code includes robust error handling to log errors and return appropriate error responses to the client.
3. **Ranking and Integration of Content Sources**: Combining the results from different content sources (videos, articles, and academic papers) and providing a unified ranking system was a key challenge. The `calculateRanking` function in the server-side code attempts to prioritize the results based on various metrics, such as view count and like count for videos.

**Advanced Filtering**:
The application now includes an advanced filtering feature that allows users to narrow the search results by content type (videos, articles, or academic papers). The `ResultsSection` component has been updated to include filter buttons that update the `filters` state in the `App` component. When the user clicks on a filter button, the `handleSearch` function is called with the updated `contentType` parameter, which is then used to filter the results before rendering them.

**Conclusion**:
This search aggregator application demonstrates the integration of multiple data sources, including YouTube videos, articles, and academic papers. The application provides a unified interface for users to search and explore content from these different sources. The advanced filtering feature empowers users to focus on specific content types based on their preferences. The project also highlights the importance of proper API integration, error handling, and result ranking to deliver a seamless user experience.
